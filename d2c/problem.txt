Problem Statement
Jaime Lannister on his way to Kings Landing found a lake of the perimeter of L. On the circumference of the lake, there is a castle of the lake's owner. Each point on the circumference of the lake has a coordinate between 0 and L (including 0 but not L), which is the distance from the castle, measured counter-clockwise.

There are N trees around the lake; the coordinate of the i-th tree is Xi. There is no tree at coordinate 0, the location of the castle.

Starting at the castle, Jaime will repeat the following action:

If all trees are burnt, terminate the process.
Specify a direction: clockwise or counter-clockwise.
Walk around the lake in the specified direction, until the coordinate of a tree that is not yet burnt is reached for the first time.
When the coordinate with the tree is reached, burn that tree, stay at the position and go back to the first step.
Find the longest possible total distance Jaime Lannister walks during the process.

Constraints:

2≤L≤10^9
1≤N≤2×10^5
1≤X1<...<XN≤L−1
